Solo project for CodeClan with the goal of building an app to consolidate and expand on the Python module, including:

* Object oriented programming with Python
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

# Brief

## Travel Bucket List
Build an app to track someone's travel adventures.

MVP:
* The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
* The user should be able to create and edit countries
* Each country should have one or more cities to visit
* The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities
* The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see
Possible Extensions:
* Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit
* Add sights to the destination cities
* Search for destination by continent, city or country
* Any other ideas you might come up with


## For this his project I used a modified brief to create a Haunted House bucket list web app using Python, Flask and PostgreSQL.

* It allows a user to track haunted locations around the world that they want to visit.
* The user can manage the lists by being able to add, edit, delete and search entries.
* The user can also keep a journal for each place that they visit.
